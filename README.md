Complex solution for a monkeytype application challenge. Made it in raw JS so the code is hard to maintain, the design respects the original layout 100%. Some parts of the logic, such as WPM calculation and typing validation, were implemented with a bit of AI consultation, and there may be minor edge cases—like slight inaccuracies in WPM or issues with typing special characters such as quotes.
Despite these small problems, the project successfully fulfills its purpose as a functional typing test platform and serves as a solid example of building interactive web applications from scratch using raw JavaScript
and understanding DOM concepts and state management products.
